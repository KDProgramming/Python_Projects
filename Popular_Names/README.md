# Name Popularity Checker

A Python program that checks whether a given boy's or girl's name was among the most popular names in a provided dataset. The program reads two text files (`BoyNames.txt` and `GirlNames.txt`), processes the data into lists, and allows the user to search for names interactively.

## Features
- **Dataset Processing**: Reads the contents of two files—one for boy names and one for girl names—and stores them in separate lists.
- **Name Search**: Allows users to enter a boy's name, a girl's name, or both, to determine if they were among the most popular names in the dataset.
- **Case Insensitivity**: Ensures names are matched regardless of capitalization.
- **Error Handling**: Provides user-friendly error messages if the input files are missing or other issues occur.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **File Handling**: Reads and processes data from text files.

## How to Run
1. Open the Python Source file (`popular_names.py`) in Visual Studio Code.
2. Run the project.
