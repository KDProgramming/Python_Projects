# Text File Analyzer

A Python program that reads a text file and calculates various statistics, including the number of words, lines, uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, occurrences of the letter "e", and whitespace characters. The program provides an easy way to analyze the contents of a file.

## Features
- **Word Count**: Counts the total number of words in the file.
- **Line Count**: Counts the number of lines in the file.
- **Character Analysis**:
  - **Uppercase Letters**: Counts the number of uppercase letters in the file.
  - **Lowercase Letters**: Counts the number of lowercase letters in the file.
  - **Digits**: Counts the number of numeric digits in the file.
  - **Occurrences of 'e'**: Counts how many times the letter "e" (case-insensitive) appears.
  - **Whitespace Characters**: Counts spaces, tabs, and newline characters.
- **Error Handling**: Provides user-friendly messages if the file is not found or other errors occur.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Uses built-in Python functions for file handling and string analysis.
