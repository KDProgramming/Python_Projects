# Email Management System

A Python program that manages names and email addresses using a dictionary. The program allows users to look up, add, update, or delete email addresses. Data is persisted between sessions using Python's `pickle` module, which serializes and deserializes the dictionary to and from a file.

## Features
- **Email Lookup**: Search for an email address by entering a person's name.
- **Add New Entries**: Add new name-email pairs to the dictionary.
- **Update Existing Entries**: Modify the email address for an existing name.
- **Delete Entries**: Remove a name and its associated email address from the dictionary.
- **Data Persistence**: Automatically saves the dictionary to a file when the program exits and reloads it when the program starts.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pickle Module**: Used for data serialization and deserialization to save and load the email dictionary.

## How to Run
1. Open the Python Source file (`email_dictionary.py`) in Visual Studio Code.
2. Run the project.
