# College Management System
A Python program that allows users to manage information about colleges, including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting records. The program uses classes to define college attributes and dictionaries to store data.

## Features

- **Search for a College**: Retrieve college details by entering the unique college ID.
- **Update Existing Records**: Modify any attribute of an existing college, such as name, address, phone number, or tuition.
- **Delete a College**: Remove a college record from the system using its ID.
- **User-Friendly Menu**: Display a menu to guide the user through available options.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes and objects used to define and manage data.
- **Dictionaries**: Used to store and organize college information for quick access.

## How to Run
