# Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python programs that I have developed as part of my coursework. 
These programs demonstrate various Python concepts, including file handling, GUI development, and data analysis. Each project is self-contained and serves as a practical example of a different Python skill.

## How to Run the Projects
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/KDProgramming/Python_Projects.git
2. Open the Python Source file (`project_name.py`) in Visual Studio Code.
3. For GUI projects (if applicable), ensure that you have any required libraries installed (e.g., Tkinter).
4. Run the project.

## Projects
- [Long-Distance Call Charge Calculator](./Call_Charges): A Python GUI application that calculates the total cost of a long-distance call based on the selected rate category and call duration.
- [College Management System](./CollegeInfo_Menu): A Python program that allows users to manage information about colleges, including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting records.
- [Primary Color Mixer](./Color_Mixer): A Python program that determines the secondary color resulting from mixing two primary colors.
- [Property Tax Calculator](./County_Taxes): A Python program that calculates the assessment value and property tax for a piece of property based on its actual value.
- [Email Management System](./Email_Dictionary): A Python program that manages names and email addresses using a dictionary. The program allows users to look up, add, update, or delete email addresses.
- [Gas Price Analyzer](./Gas_Prices): A Python program that processes gas price data from 1993 to 2013 to perform various analyses, including calculating average prices, finding the highest and lowest prices, and sorting prices.
- [Telephone Number Translator](./PhoneNum_Translate): A Python program that converts alphabetic characters in a 10-character telephone number (e.g., `1-800-FLOWERS`) into their numeric equivalents, following the standard telephone keypad mappings.
- [Name Popularity Checker](./Popular_Names): A Python program that checks whether a given boy's or girl's name was among the most popular names in a provided dataset.
- [Product Management System](./Products_Menu): A Python program that manages product numbers and names using a dictionary. Users can add, look up, update, delete, and list products through an interactive menu system.
- [Text File Analyzer](./TextFile_Calculations): A Python program that reads a text file and calculates various statistics, including the number of words, lines, uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, occurrences of the letter "e", and whitespace characters.
