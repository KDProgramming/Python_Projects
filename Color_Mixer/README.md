# Primary Color Mixer
A Python program that determines the secondary color resulting from mixing two primary colors. If the user enters a color that is not a primary color, the program displays an error message.

## Features
- **Primary Color Validation**: Ensures the user inputs only primary colors (red, blue, yellow).
- **Mixing Logic**: Determines and displays the resulting secondary color based on the two inputs:
  - Red + Blue = Purple
  - Red + Yellow = Orange
  - Blue + Yellow = Green
- **Error Handling**: Alerts the user when invalid colors are entered.

## Technologies
- **Python**: The program uses basic Python features, including conditional statements and user input handling.

## How to Run
1. Open the Python Source file (`Color_Mixer.py`) in Visual Studio Code.
2. Run the project.
