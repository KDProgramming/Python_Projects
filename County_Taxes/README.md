# Property Tax Calculator

A Python program that calculates the assessment value and property tax for a piece of property based on its actual value. This program demonstrates the use of constants, modular functions, and mathematical operations.

## Features
- **Assessment Value Calculation**: Determines the assessment value as 60% of the property's actual value.
- **Property Tax Calculation**: Computes property tax as 72Â¢ for every $100 of the assessment value.
- **User-Friendly Input**: Prompts the user to enter the actual value of the property and outputs the computed assessment value and property tax.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Utilizes Python's constants, functions, and input handling to perform calculations.

## How to Run
1. Open the Python Source file (`County_Taxes.py`) in Visual Studio Code.
2. Run the project.
