# Telephone Number Translator

A Python program that converts alphabetic characters in a 10-character telephone number (e.g., `1-800-FLOWERS`) into their numeric equivalents, following the standard telephone keypad mappings.

## Features
- **Input Validation**: Ensures the input matches the `XXX-XXX-XXXX` format before proceeding.
- **Character Translation**: Converts alphabetic characters to their numeric equivalents based on telephone keypad mappings:
  - `A, B, C` → `2`
  - `D, E, F` → `3`
  - `G, H, I` → `4`
  - `J, K, L` → `5`
  - `M, N, O` → `6`
  - `P, Q, R, S` → `7`
  - `T, U, V` → `8`
  - `W, X, Y, Z` → `9`
- **Seamless Output**: Displays the translated telephone number in the same format.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Implements string manipulation and input validation to achieve translation.

## How to Run
1. Open the Python Source file (`phoneNum_translate.py`) in Visual Studio Code.
